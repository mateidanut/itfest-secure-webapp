# Secure Voice-based login

This React project demonstrates a voice-based login system that verifies the user's voice timbre during login against the one used during registration.

The system provides a secure and convenient login experience, eliminating the need for passwords or sensitive information.

The project is built using React and is available on GitHub for anyone interested in exploring the implementation details.
